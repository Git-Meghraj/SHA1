# SHA1 Implementation in C

## Overview
This repository contains a **C implementation of the SHA‑1 cryptographic hashing algorithm**. SHA‑1 converts any input string into a **fixed 160-bit hash**, demonstrating key concepts of hashing such as **message padding, bitwise rotations, and logical functions**.

> **Note:** SHA‑1 is no longer recommended for new security-critical applications. This project is intended for **educational purposes** and as a starting point for learning more advanced hashing algorithms like SHA‑256 and SHA‑3.

## Features
- Converts any input string into a 160-bit hash.
- Handles short and long input strings.
- Demonstrates the avalanche effect — even small changes in input produce completely different hashes.
